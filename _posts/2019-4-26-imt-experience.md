title: Working at IMT Computer Services as a Programming Intern
---

Working at IMT gave me an insight of what I might have to look forward to in my upcoming career.
I gained hands-on experience participating in an agile work environment,
contributing to frontend and backend web applications, pair programming, TDD, etc.
I learned how to communicate effectively with both a technical audience and non-technical
audience when addressing new features and bug fixes. By the end of the internship, I had
contributed to several projects (not all equally) and redesigned the company's product dashboard.

I came in as a fresh Java boy tainted by university and left as a junior developer with some
insight on the software development industry.
